# Amiga Roms Script
Python script that downloads all games from
[whdownloads](https://www.whdownload.com/games.php?name=%&sort=0&dir=0).

## How to run

This program uses the module webdriver from
selenium, so you need:

```shell
pip install selenium
```

To run it, use:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

This was made with a UNIX like environment, it
works in Linux and MACOS - it hasn't been tested
in Windows.

---

This was made because the website in question
doesn't have an option to download all games.
This is legal, don't be afraid to use it.
And please contribute to make this a better
project!
